	  foreman: command-line utility used to launch multiple instances of the app using Procfile
	  NGINX: used for load balancing, once you have it installed use the file "default"
			 located in the main project directory as its configuration file 

    ~ What is MiniTwit?

      A SQLite and Flask powered twitter clone

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the minitwit.py file or
         export a MINITWIT_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. install both the minitwitWebapp and minitwitAPI apps by running the following 
		 command from their respective project directories

         pip install --editable .

      4. fire up a shell and run these commands to initialize the database:
		 FLASK_APP=minitwit_api flask initdb
		 FLASK_APP=minitwit_api flask populatedb

      5. navigate to the minitwit directory and run this command to launch three instances
		 of the API and three instances of the web application:
		 foreman start 

      You can now reach the web application at:
      http://127.0.0.1/

	  As you use the web application NGINX will direct you and any backend requests
	  the application makes to the appropriate servers in a round robin fashion.
